        <div>SRS is the document that completely describes what the proposed 
            <h1> software should do without describing </h1>
            <p>how the software will do it. </p>
            The basic purpose of SRS is to bridge the communication gap between the parties involved in the development of the software. SRS is a medium through which the client and the user needs are accurately specified. 
            A good SRS should satisfy all the parties â€“ something very hard to achieve and involves trade-offs and persuasion. Another important purpose of developing an SRS is helping the user to understand their own needs.</div>
